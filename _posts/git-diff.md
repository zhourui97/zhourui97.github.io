# Preface

	git diff $start_commit $end_commit -- path/to/file
	git diff $start_commit path/to/file
	git diff $start_commit

For instance, to see the difference for a file "main.c" between now and two commits back, here are three equivalent commands:

	$ git diff HEAD^^ HEAD main.c
	$ git diff HEAD^^..HEAD -- main.c
	$ git diff HEAD~2 HEAD -- main.c

> The .. isn't really necessary, though it'll work with it (except in fairly old versions, maybe). 
> The -- is useful e.g. when you have a file named -p

Equal:

	HEAD~1 HEAD^	HEAD~
	HEAD~2 HEAD^^	HEAD~~
	HEAD~3
	//refer to # revision

## git show 
git show specify commit

	git show aa73513
	git show --name-only SHA1

## git diff filelist

	git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2

where you only need to include enough of the SHA to identify the commits. You can also do, for example

	git diff --name-only HEAD~10 HEAD~5

shows *what operations were done* to the files too

	git diff --name-status [TAG|SHA1] 

## difftool

	git config --global alias.d difftool

## diff object

	## diff between working and staged
	git diff

	## diff between staged and commit
	#diff between staged file and commited file
	git diff --staged // same as : git diff --cached

	## diff working & commit
	git diff HEAD
	git diff HEAD ./lib # diff sub-dir between working & HEAD 
	git diff branch1 //diff current branch based on branch1 
	git diff branch1 feature//diff feature based on branch1 

	## diff 2 branch
	git diff master..branch1 #diff branch1 based on The Parent of master&branch1 基于共同祖先做diff, 即得到branch1的变更.
	## The following 3 commands is equal in function.
	git log origin/master..HEAD
	git log ^origin/master HEAD
	git log HEAD --not origin/master

	## 如果你想查找所有从refA或refB包含的但是不被refC包含的提交
	git log refA refB ^refC
	git log refA refB --not refC

	## 如果你想查 看master或者experiment中包含的但不是两者共有的引用
	$ git log master...experiment //两者的并集再减去交集
	F
	E
	D
	# 这种情形下,log命令的一个常用参数是--left-right,它会显示每个提交到底处于哪一 侧的分支
	$ git log --left-right master...experiment 
	<F
	<E
	>D

## diff option

	#--stat just print statistic
	git diff master..branch1 --stat
	#check white space at the end of line
	git diff --check

## diff name only

	git diff-index --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR HEAD

## merge-base

	//先找共同祖先
	$git merge-base branch1 master //find the Parent of branch and master
		bb92d38751bde50b5520a78b82c288fd6edaee9d
	//基于祖先做diff or git diff master...branch1
	$git diff bb92
